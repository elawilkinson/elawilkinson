👋 Hi, I’m Emma. I’m interested in tech as a force for good! And also in desserts.

🤖 I'm currently working full-time as a Software Engineer for a consultancy, and volunteering in my evening-weekend time for an app in the sexual health space. 

📽️ After a career in the Film & TV industry, I was lucky enough to win a place on <a href="https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/" rel="nofollow"> School of Code's </a> intensive 16-week bootcamp in Full-Stack JavaScript Development. My previous career honed my collaboration, innovation and adaptability skills, and I'm now excited to bring these with me as a I transfer to tech.<g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="rocket">🚀</g-emoji>. 

🐈‍⬛I love DIY, animals and pressing social causes - so if you want to talk about any of these, or about software projects, drop me a line!

♟️ I'm also a very old-fashioned nerd and love to talk maths, logic, and problem-solving. See you on Codewars!!
